        </h1>
        <p>Facebook-owned WhatsApp appears to be working on new multiple device support with 
            synchronized chat history. WABetaInfo reports that WhatsApp is testing the ability to use an account on multiple devices, 
            including a separate iPad app. WhatsApp currently supports multiple devices through WhatsApp Web, which connects back to a phone account.

            WhatsApp Web requires a phone to be powered on and connected to the web, but this new multiple
            device support wonâ€™t need to constantly connect back to a phone and will allow people to use WhatsApp on multiple devices simultaneously.
            
            This new multiple devices feature, which has been rumored for months, will also likely support chat history sync, allowing WhatsApp users to sync their messages across 
            devices. WABetaInfo also reports that WhatsApp will release its long-rumored iPad app once the multiple devices support is ready to be released.
            
            WhatsApp now has 2 billion users and has been introducing features to limit the forwarding of viral messages in recent 
            months. WhatsApp also added a search feature last week to help users debunk misinformation that can spread on the messaging service.</p>
